#Haiku-Bot
# A rather basic haiku poem generator.

Haiku-Bot utilizes a syllabalized and part-of-speech-keyed dictionary to
randomly generate haiku poems for fun. It &hearts;'s [Lo-Dash] and [Bootstrap]
just like it should.

See it in action [here].

### Make it so:
  - Have your [Node] sorted
  - Get ahold of [Grunt]
  - Have a server like [WAMP] or [XAMPP]
  - Checkout or download this repo
  - 'cd' to it on the command-line and run 'npm install'
  - Run 'grunt' or 'grunt build' to create the 'dist/'

Enjoy!
